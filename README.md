# Kidney Disease Prediction Model using Ensemble Learning
This repository contains a kidney disease prediction model built using ensemble learning techniques. The model aims to predict whether a patient is likely to have kidney disease based on various input attributes. The model has achieved an impressive 100% accuracy on the test dataset.

Live Demo: [Kidney Disease Prediction](https://kidney-disease-prediction-using-ensemble.streamlit.app/)

# Dataset
The model is trained and tested on a kidney disease dataset (kidney.csv) that contains various features related to a patient's health and laboratory test results. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and transformed into a format suitable for model training.

# Input Attributes
The prediction application allows users to input the following attributes:

  1. Age (Years): The age of the patient.
  2. Blood Pressure (mm/Hg): The patient's blood pressure.
  3. Specific Gravity (SG): The specific gravity of urine, indicating urine concentration.
  4. Albumin Level (g/L): The level of albumin in the blood, which can indicate kidney health.
  5. Sugar Level: The level of sugar in the urine.
  6. Red Blood Cell Count: Whether the red blood cell count is normal or abnormal.
  7. Pus Cell Count: Whether the pus cell count is normal or abnormal.
  8. Pus Cell Clumps: Whether pus cell clumps are present or not.
  9. Bacterial Infection: Whether a bacterial infection is present or not.
  10. Blood Glucose Random (mgs/dl): Random blood glucose level.
  11. Blood Urea (mgs/dl): Blood urea level.
  12. Serum Creatinine (mgs/dl): Serum creatinine level.
  13. Sodium (mEq/L): Sodium level in the blood.
  14. Potassium (mEq/L): Potassium level in the blood.
  15. Hemoglobin (gms): Hemoglobin level.
  16. Packed Cell Volume: Packed cell volume level.
  17. White Blood Cell Count (cells/cumm): White blood cell count.
  18. Red Blood Cell Count (millions/cmm): Red blood cell count.
  19. Hypertension: Whether the patient has hypertension or not.
  20. Diabetes Mellitus: Whether the patient has diabetes mellitus or not.
  21. Coronary Artery Disease: Whether the patient has coronary artery disease or not.
  22. Appetite: The patient's appetite (good or poor).
  23. Pedal Edema: Whether the patient has pedal edema or not.
  24. Anemia: Whether the patient has anemia or not.
